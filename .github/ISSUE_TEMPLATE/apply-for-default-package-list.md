**Link to "packageinfo.ccpt"-file**
If you are now asking yourself: "What is a 'packageinfo.ccpt'-file?", then you should still wait a bit with applying :) [Click here to get started](https://github.com/PentagonLP/ccpt/wiki/Create-your-own-package)

**Suggested package ID**
You may suggest an ID for your package under which your package will be able to be installed, please make sure that it isn't already taken (eg by issuing the command 'ccpt info <Your ID>'). We can't guarantee though if this ID will be the final one.
